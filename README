This is a hybrid vector class unifying 2 vector types, a ram-based one, and a
disk-based one. Defaults are std::vector<T> and stxxl::vector<T>, for ram and disk,
respectively.

This template class is, for the most part, a ReversibleContainer and Sequence.
However, the following points disqualify this class from formally being a Container,
and by extension, a ReversibleContainer:
* No formal Allocator: the typedef's are there, but allocate() and deallocate() are
  undefined, as modifying the file allocator to use Allocator semantics would be
  quite an undertaking. Furthermore, with heterogenous allocator types, the only
  thing certain about the Allocator is that it would be of little use because the
  requirement that the memory and disk vector allocators have a compatible
  interface is non-existent.
* Allocator vector constructor is undefined: the implementation of such would require
  the creation of a formal Allocator class. There would also be considerable
  complexity in designing the constructor to make implications about state
  invariants.
* get_allocator is undefined because there is no Allocator.

The following points disqualify this class from formally being a Sequence:
(Required)
* No insert(). For the most part, bulk inserts for vector containers are appends,
  so template <typename InputIterator> append(InputIterator, InputIterator) is
  implemented.
* erase() is not implemented. It is a waste of effort to implement a
  rarely-used function that is slow by definition.

(Optional)
* at() is not implemented. Use [] instead.
* push_front(), pop_front() are not implemented. Nothing new here, see std::vector<T>.
